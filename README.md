## Twitter Bootstrap
Is a responsive design framework.
  Somewhere between a canned CMS and a site built from raw CSS.

### Install Emmet (optional)
  
  http://emmet.io
  
### Examples
[BuiltwithBootstrap](http://builtwithbootstrap.com)

[LoveBootstrap](http://lovebootstrap.com)

[ExpoBootstrap](http://expo.bootstrap.com)
Sites noticed by developers of bootstrap.

### Mobile first approach.
  Think about design on small devices, phones.

### I.E 8 and higher.
  Need some hack to get I.E 8 to work otherwise works on I.E 9 and above.

### No more sprites
  Could not scale up or change color. Because they are built with raster images.

### Font icons are vector icons
  Can scale up fonts. Because they are with vector images.
  
### Built with LESS
* [LESS](http://www.lesscss.org/)

### Competitors
* [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
	* Built with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/guide)


## Pros
* Some of the work is already done for you.
* Customizable

	Doesn't NEED to look like all the other sites that use bootstrap.

## Cons
* Code "bloat"
   
   More code that if this was developed for one app using  custom CSS/HTML/JS.

* Built with LESS
   
   Rails uses SASS/SCSS by default. But, there is a gem that works around this problem.

## Downloads

###Avoid customization in the download.
  
  Will have to remember all the choices in this version if you have get a more
  recent version.

### Only need the css, fonts and js directories.
  
### You will get the minified and plain files.

### Fonts
   Series of icons you can use. All vector based, as opposed to raster based.

### Javascript.
Bootstrap javascript depends on JQuery. Add jquery to the bottom of the body, the footer.
   This will make sure that the HTML is loaded before the javascript.

### Add bootstrap.js after jquery
