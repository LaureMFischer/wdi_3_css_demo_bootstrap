## Twitter Bootstrap
Is a responsive design framework.
  Somewhere between a canned CMS and a site built from raw CSS.

### Install Emmet (optional)
  
  http://emmet.io
  
### Examples
	http://builtwithbootstrap.com
	http://lovebootstrap.com
	http://expo.bootstrap.com
  Noticed by developers of bootstrap.

### Mobile first approach.
  Think about design on small devices, phones.

### I.E 8 and higher.
  Need some hack to get I.E 8 to work otherwise works on I.E 9 and above.

### No more sprites
  Could not scale up or change color.

### Font icons are vector icons
  Can scale up fonts.

### Competitors, Zurb foundation.


## Pros
* Some of the work is already done for you.
* Customizable

	Doesn't NEED to look like all the other sites that use bootstrap.

## Cons
* Code "bloat"
   
   More code that if this was developed for one app using  custom CSS/HTML/JS.

## Downloads

###Avoid customization in the download.
  
  Will have to remember all the choices in this version if you have get a more
  recent version.

### Only need the css, fonts and js directories.
  
### You will get the minified and plain files.

### Fonts
   Series of icons you can use. All vector based, as opposed to raster based.

### Javascript.
Bootstrap javascript depends on JQuery. Add jquery to the bottom of the body, the footer.
   This will make sure that the HTML is loaded before the javascript.

### Add bootstrap.js after jquery

## Grid
